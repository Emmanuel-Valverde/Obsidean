# Chapter 1 y 2:
In this chapter, we will define functional thinking and how its major dis-tinction helps working programmers build better software.

What is FP?
Is programming paradigm for general purpose, most of the bibliography you will find about FP  comes from the academic world, this book tries to do the opposite.


## Problems you encounter with FP
**Problem 1**: FP needs side effects The definition says FP avoids side effects, but side effects are the very reason we run our software. What good is email software that doesn’t send emails? The definition implies that we completely avoid them, when in reality, we use side effects when we have to.

**Problem 2**: FP is good at side effects Functional programmers know side effects are necessary yet problematic, so we have a lot of tools for working with them. The definition implies that we only use pure functions. On the contrary, we use impure functions a lot. We have a ton of functional techniques that make them easier to use.

**Problem 3**: FP is practical The definition makes FP seem like it’s mostly mathematical and impractical for real-world software. There are many important software systems written using functional programming.

The definition is especially confusing to people who are introduced to FP through the definition. Let’s see an example of a well-intentioned manager who reads the definition on Wikipedia.
